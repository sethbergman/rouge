If Formatter.enable_escape! is called, this allows escaping into html
or the parent format with a special delimiter. For example, here is
some <!<span style="text-decoration: underline">!>underlined text<!</span>!> that flows with the rest of the document.

When visually speccing this, you should see the escaped portions rendered as an
error. This is because for safety reasons we don't allow escaping to html without
explicit opting in. If you provide the ?escape=1 option in the url, you should
see underlined text.
